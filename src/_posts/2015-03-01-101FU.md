# Follow up

It's been a week since you completed CSS Animation 101. I just wanted to catch up and find out how you got on.

## Some questions

I hope you've found the course useful, inspiring, helpful or some combination. I'd love to know, have you had a chance to try what you'd learned on any projects?

Was the course what you expected?

While the course tried to cover transitions and animations, do you think it managed to cover them in enough detail? (or too much?)

Having finished the course, what would you like to know more of? Was the a topic not covered that you'd like to know more about?

Did you find the email format worked? Was it too slow, or too fast?

Lastly, would you like to supply a testimonial and be featured on the product page with a link to your site?
