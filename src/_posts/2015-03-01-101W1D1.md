{{ subscriber.first_name }}, welcome to the first email of the Getting Started with CSS Animation!

Over the next four weeks we'll explore the concepts of CSS *transitions* and *animations*. By the end we'll have a good understanding of what these are, and the tools to easily create and experiment with our own.

The class will be a mix of theory and practical examples. I'll be sharing some tools and ways to easily create your own working environment. To make the most of this course, it's worth trying the examples, changing the code and seeing what happens.

Here's what we'll be covering.

**Week 1:** In this first week, we'll introduce transitions and animations are and and how they relate to web pages.

Along the way I'll be sharing sources for inspiration and other resources to keep in mind to help understand what animation can do for you.

**Week 2:** Next week we'll start looking at the **transition** property, the way browsers animate between one state and another.

**Week 3:** We'll take on the **animation** property. We'll learn how animations differ from transitions and when you'd want to use an animation.

**Week 4:** Finally in the last week we'll bring these concepts together and learn how to apply the concepts, performance issues to look out for, and some JavaScript tools we can use.

## Need to brush up on your CSS?

If you're new to CSS, it might be worth taking time to get familiar with the concepts. We'll be digging into code from week 2, so there's time to do some reading. Some online tools and resources you might find helpful:

* [Interactive HTML/CSS tutorials](http://www.codeavengers.com) 
* [Learn to Code HTML&CSS](http://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/)
