**Welcome to CSS Animation 101!**

I'm delighted you've chosen to take part in this course, and hope you find it helpful and fun. Over the next four weeks we're going to learn about CSS *transitions* and *animations*. By the end you'll have a good understanding of what these and the tools to create and experiment with our own.

There will be both theory and practical examples. We'll learn how to easily create your own working environment, and look at lots of examples of animation along the way.

## Structure

Here's the plan for the next four weeks.

**Week 1:** What's animation anyway? This week we'll look at why we animate. We'll also introduce the `transition` and `animation` property and some sources of inspiration.

**Week 2:** All about the **transition** property. We'll learn how transitions work, and the properties we can control to change the movement.

**Week 3:** We'll take on the **animation** property, and learn how to create keyframes that go beyond simple transitions.

**Week 4:** Bringing it all together. We'll cover performance issues to look out for, helpful CSS resources we can apply to projects, and JavaScript tools we can use for more advanced effects.

## Bonus content

Along the way I'll be sharing tools to help develop animations locally, cheat sheets for quick reference and if you like, I'll feature your creations on the CSS Animation Hall of Fame!

## Need to brush up on your CSS?

If you're new to CSS, it might be worth taking time to get familiar with the concepts. You don't need to be an expert in CSS. If you know what a property is, you'll be fine.
