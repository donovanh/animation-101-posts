# Transitions

When working on the web we use HTML and CSS to describe how our web pages are structured and how they look.

Browsers used to be much more simple than they are today. It wasn't so long ago that they couldn't even render images, or handle more than a handful of fonts. But with CSS, we have much more power over how our web pages look and feel.

One relatively recent addition to the browsers' abilities is animation. Animation in a browser can be handled in many ways, using JavaScript to manipulate positioning, Canvas for embedded content, or directly through CSS. We'll be covering the latter.

## Transitions

One of the ways CSS lets us control animation in the browser is by using the `transition` property. A transition is essentially the animation from one state to another.

When we use a transition on an element on our web page, we tell the browser that we want it to **interpolate**, or automatically calculate, the change from one state to another.

This means that if we change an element's height, and apply a transition, the browser will create a smooth transition between the element's starting height and it's changed height.

Transitions control the speed with which the styles change, what properties the transitions act on, and the rate at which the transitions occur. These are all handled by `transition properties`, which we'll cover in week 2.

## In summary

A transition is the change from one state to another. For example, when hovering over an element, it's style might change. Transitions allow the change to become a smooth animation.

## Homework

Between now and tomorrow's email, try to keep your eyes open for examples of transitions. Look for interesting changes that happen when something changes, such as when a new element is added to a page, or you hover over a button.

Tomorrow, we'll take a moment to discuss what the CSS `animation` property is and how it differs from transitions.
