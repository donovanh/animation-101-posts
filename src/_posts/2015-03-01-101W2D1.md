# More about Transitions

Last week we talked about what animation on the web is, and why we might want to use it. We also discussed what makes a transition and what makes an animation. It's time to delve further into transitions and see some code!

## Transitions

Transitions take place in the browser when an element changes from one state to another. The browser draws the frames between each state automatically to create an animation.

We can write a transition in CSS like this:

    transition: background 0.5s linear;

In this example we're telling the browser that a transition of the background property, will take half a second, and use the "linear" timing function.

The above property might cause a button's background to change when hovered over:

    button {
      background: white;
      transition: background 0.5s linear;
    }

    button:hover {
      background: green;
    }

Notice that I've added the `transition` property to the first "button" reference in the CSS state. This tells the browser to apply the transition to any change of state such as on hover as well as when changing back *from* the hover state. If we applied the transition property to the hover state only, it would only transition *to* the hover state but not back.

## Try yourself

[Here's a CodePen](http://codepen.io/donovanh/pen/MYQdZd) demonstrating the hover effect. In CodePen, you can make changes to the HTML and CSS and see the results immediately. Try changing some of the values and see what happens!

Look for these lines:

    transition-property: all;
    transition-duration: 0.4s;
    transition-timing-function: ease-out;

This code that tells the button what to do when a state changes. It tells the browser to animate all properties (colours, size, position), over a duration of 0.4 seconds.

Try changing some of these values. For example, change the "0.4s" to something longer, like "2s" (two seconds). How does the animation feel? You could change the property from "all" to "background".

## Transition structure

The `transition` property is made up of some properties that we can use to control various aspects. We'll go into these properties in greater detail tomorrow. For now though, keep in mind that these properties can be written in full (as above) or else on one line as shorthand.

<div class="callout">
  <h2>Homework</h2>

[TODO]

  <h3>Bonus</h3>
  <p>Try changing the <code>transition-timing-function</code> value from <code>ease-out</code> to:</p>
  <pre><code>cubic-bezier(.59,-0.26,.33,1.42)</code></pre>
  <p>I do like the cubic bezier timing function. We'll cover timing functions in more detail on Wednesday!</p>
</div>

**Tomorrow:** We take a look through `transition` properties and see them in action.
