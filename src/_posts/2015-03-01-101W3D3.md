# Keyframes

## Using timing functions within keyframes

It's worth noting that when you specify a timing function for an animation, the timing function applies to *each keyframe* of the animation.

This means that if you were to specify four keyframes, the timing function would apply to each. An ease-out function would slow down as it approached each keyframe.

For that reason we would usually define the timing function for animations as linear, and control the pacing on a per-keyframe basis:

    @keyframes my-animation {
      0%   {
      ...
      animation-timing-function: linear;
      }
      50% {
      ...
      animation-timing-function: ease-out;
      }
    }

In this case the first half of the animation will be linear, and the second half would use the `ease-out`.
