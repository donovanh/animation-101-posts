# Storytelling

Now that we've covered both the `transition` and `animation` property, let's combine both into an animation with a hover effect.

## Heroes

Many sites like to make use of a large, attention-grabbing image at the top of their homepage. Sometimes called a "hero image", this is usually a full-width banner style element.

A nice example I found recently was the [Fabric](https://getfabric.io) landing page.

<div class="example">
  <img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/course-images/fabric.gif" style="max-width: 200px; margin: 24px auto 0; display: block;">
  <p class="source"><a href="https://get.fabric.io/">Source</a></p>
</div>

Here there's some nicely created CSS animatiom showing how Fabric works as a modular framework. Another interesting example is the [Mailchimp homepage](http://mailchimp.com). Here the hero image tells a story by demonstrating how emails are created.

You may have also seen it in action on this course's landing page:

Today, we'll create an example of our own. In this example I've created a "web page" style graphic that moves up and down the screen. When you hover over the image, the animation pauses and a message is shown. It makes use of both animations and transitions to achieve the effect.

<div class="example">
  <img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/course-images/screen-hover.gif" style="max-width: 400px; margin: 24px auto 0; display: block;">
  <p class="source"><a href="http://codepen.io/donovanh/pen/LEwedW?editors=110">Source</a></p>
</div>

  <p class="source"><a href="http://codepen.io/donovanh/pen/LEwedW?editors=110">Source</a></p>
</div>

## Part 2: Adding the hover transition
